This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project for predicting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The project is part of a Coursera course on machine learning.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on certain features.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the well-known Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of breast masses, which are used to predict the diagnosis (malignant or benign).

### Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes Python and several popular libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, including:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Steps
The project is structured as follows:
1. Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset is loaded into the notebook, and an initial exploration
   of the data is performed to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data by handling missing values, encoding
   categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations are created to gain insights into the distribution
   of features and relationships between variables.
4. Feature Selection: Based on EDA, important features are selected for training the machine
   learning models.
5. Model Building: Several machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
   Support Vector Machines) are trained on the dataset to predict breast cancer diagnosis.
6. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy,
   precision, recall) and visualizations (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve).
7. Conclusion: A summary of the findings from the analysis and recommendations for further steps are provided.

### Usage
To run the notebook:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).
- Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb file.
- Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each cell and observe the results.

### Results
The final outcome of this project is a well-documented Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the entire process of building and evaluating machine learning models for breast cancer prediction. The notebook includes detailed explanations, visualizations, and interpretations of the analysis.
